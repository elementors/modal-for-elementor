# PopBox For Elementor

PopBox for Elementor allows the creation of beautiful templates with Elementor Page Builder for use with the included Popbox overlay script.    

An Admin menu will be added on your Wordpress Dashboard sidepane named PopBoxes. This is the custom post type (CPT) you'll use to create the content of the PopBox.    

A custom module will also be added to Elementor Page Builder edit screen to be used for the customiztion of the trigger button embeded on your page.    
Simply select one of the PopBox content created via the CPT to be shown when the trigger button is clicked.

TODO
Rework the enqueue method so that scripts only load on pages using the PopBox. (Perhaps also trimming down the script files so inly needed elements are loaded)!
